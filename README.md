# FPGAMario
A Mario-like game built to run on an Altera DE2-115 board for the ECE 385 final project

Completed 12/12/2019

As the name implies, this is a simple version of Mario built almost entirely in SystemVerilog. Only USB I/O, which is used for the keyboard inputs, is done in C code. Some of the notable features include sprites, animations, and goombas. The game can be seen on a VGA monitor, and most keyboards ought to suffice for user input.
